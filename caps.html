                alt="An illustration contains the psychological problems that a student may have.">
            <p>We focus on 18 commonly experienced issues (e.g., making friends, imposter phenomenon, time management,
                feeling overwhelmed, etc.) you may face during your adjustment to U-M. We also provide practical
                strategies on how to ease your transition to university student life and promote positive psychological
                well-being. We want to acknowledge that you are starting your university experience during a global
                pandemic and that some of the recommendations may need to be modified in order to take into account
                health and safety guidelines.
