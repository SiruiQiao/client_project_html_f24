            <h2>Academic Advising Overview</h2>
            <p>Academic Advising is a process where students envision, execute, and reflect on their academic plans
                with guidance from a qualified UMSI Academic Advisor. Students share their goals, challenges, and
                questions with their academic advisor, and their academic advisor contributes knowledge of
                university and program requirements, policies, and processes. Together, we develop an academic plan
                that aligns with the student's personal and professional goals.
